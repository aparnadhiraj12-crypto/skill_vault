The design employs large, geometric sans-serif typography with clean lines and strong presence, often using gradient fills for headlines to enhance the futuristic and dynamic feel. The layout is modular and asymmetrical, combining split sections, horizontal color bars, and scattered polaroid-style images to create a visually engaging and layered composition. Generous negative space and minimal navigation contribute to clarity and focus. The overall aesthetic balances a tech-forward, innovative tone with approachable human elements through informal photo treatments and captions, making it suitable for creative, digital, or technology-driven brands.",

The 'secondary' color serves as a background for content blocks or secondary UI areas, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons in these areas to maintain readability. The 'contentBlockBackground' custom color is ideal for subtle section backgrounds that need to stand out gently against the main background without overwhelming the design. Use 'buttonOutline' for secondary or outlined buttons to maintain brand consistency. The 'iconColor' is suited for icons and minor graphic elements, providing a muted contrast that complements the overall palette.

The 'contentBlockBackground' against 'background' offers a gentle contrast suitable for non-textual UI elements and backgrounds.

    "designSummary": "This brand identity features a bold, modern, and high-contrast visual design centered around a black background that anchors vibrant neon accent colors including purple, lime green, bright blue, pastel pink, soft gray, and vivid orange. The design employs large, geometric sans-serif typography with clean lines and strong presence, often using gradient fills for headlines to enhance the futuristic and dynamic feel. The layout is modular and asymmetrical, combining split sections, horizontal color bars, and scattered polaroid-style images to create a visually engaging and layered composition. Generous negative space and minimal navigation contribute to clarity and focus. The overall aesthetic balances a tech-forward, innovative tone with approachable human elements through informal photo treatments and captions, making it suitable for creative, digital, or technology-driven brands.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' black color as the dominant background to create a high-contrast environment that makes accent colors pop. The 'secondary' purple is ideal for key headings and interactive elements, paired with 'primaryForeground' white for readability. Use 'limeGreen', 'brightBlue', 'softGray', 'pastelPink', and 'vividOrange' as vibrant accent colors for data visualization bars, highlights, and call-to-action elements. These colors should be used in solid blocks or gradients to maintain visual energy and clarity. Text on all the Text on colored backgrounds should use 'secondaryForeground' to ensure accessibility except for Text on 'secondary' background which should use 'Primary FG' to ensure accessibility. The palette supports a futuristic and dynamic brand personality while maintaining legibility and user focus.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' white on 'primary' black background provides excellent WCAG AAA contrast. Text in 'secondary' purple on black also meets WCAG AA standards for large text. Accent colors such as 'limeGreen', 'brightBlue', 'pastelPink', and 'vividOrange' on black backgrounds maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility. When using colored bars with black text, ensure the text color is 'secondaryForeground' black on lighter accent backgrounds like 'softGray' and 'limeGreen' to meet WCAG AA contrast ratios."
